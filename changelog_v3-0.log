##Dev Note:
*With v3.0 of Warping Wonders I overhauled many things in the codebase.*
*Those changes should go mainly unnoticed by players but will increase performance and code stability which makes the data pack more easily maintainable by me.*

*But if you happen to catch a bug, feel free to report it on our discord server (linked on the main page).*


## Changes:
### Waypoint Hub:
- Waypoint Hub GUI is now utlizing Minecrafts new Dialogs instead of a Barrel Menu
- Waypoint Hub Menus now only show destinations a player can teleport to (public/own private ones)
- Default Tool to mine/break a Waypoint Hub is a Pickaxe
- Left/Right clicking the Icon of a Waypoint Hub (you placed) with a renamed Name Tag still changes the Waypoint's Name
- Left/Right clicking the Icon of a Waypoint Hub (you placed) with a Dye changes the text color
- Left/Right clicking the Icon of a Waypoint Hub (you placed) with a Waypoint Lock changes the accessibility of a waypoint (private/public)

- Right clicking the Icon of a Waypoint Hub without a renamed Name Tag now opens the new Menu
- Placing a Wool block below the Waypoint Hub disables the announcement for players teleporting to it
