##Dev Note:
*With v3.0 of Warping Wonders I overhauled many aspects of the codebase.*
*Those changes should go mainly unnoticed by players but will increase performance and code stability which makes the data pack more easily maintainable by me.*

*But if you happen to catch a bug, feel free to report it on our discord server (linked on the main page).*
